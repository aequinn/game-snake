## Project Background

This is a simple game based on the classic arcade game Snake. It was seeded from a course on [Srimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/snakegame) by [Ania Kubow](https://twitter.com/ania_kubow)

## How it was built

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## What's in it

The game is simple and consists of a few simple elements

-   Gameboard size picker
-   A snake that grows and gets faster
-   Keyboard commands to move the snake
-   Random fruits the snake can eat
-   Scoreboard
